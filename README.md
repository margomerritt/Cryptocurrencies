# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

### Purpose
Unsupervised learning is used to create an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. Client company requested a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Unsupervised learning was chosen because client does not have a known output of what they are looking for. A clustering algorithm was chosen to group the cryptocurrencies. 

Project consists of four technical analysis parts. Deliverable 1 consists of preprocesssing the data for PCA. Deliverable 2 reduces the data dimensions using PCA. Deliverable 3 clusters the cryptocurrencies using K-means. Deliverable 4 visualizes the cryptocurrency results.
